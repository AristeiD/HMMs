# CT-HMM
(Continuous-time Hidden Markov Model)

Implementation of EM algorithms for CT-HMM:

Algorithm sources:

1) http://papers.nips.cc/paper/5792-efficient-learning-of-continuous-time-hidden-markov-models-for-disease-progression.pdf
2) http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=18626

(2) is the source of subrutines for algorithms described in (1). 

The output of the project will be independent library implemented more versions of algorithm. (It is supposed to be open-source, it doesn't exist any free accessible implementation. )

the library will be:
- documented
- tested

- using Numpy and computational expensive parts may be covered by Cython. 
- containing ipython notebook with examples of use (pandas, matplotlib)
